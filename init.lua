description = [[
Allows characters to fulfill the "Be close to the draconic world" requirement for Draconic Will and Draconic Body by eating just one of the "Heart of the Sandworm Queen" or "Wyrm Bile". This lets non-wyrmic characters access the prodigies at lv25 instead of having to wait to lv42 as usual.
